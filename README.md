# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Prediction-of-Systemic-Lupus-Erythematosus

###### Artificial Intelligence is widely used in health care to classify and predict diseases. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) isthe most common type of lupus and presents intricate challenges in accurate prediction due to its multifaceted nature. SLE is an inflammatory disease caused by the immune system attacking its tissues. Lupus most likely originates from a synthesis of genetics and environmental challenges. This study used the GEO dataset to develop an accurate and precise model for the prediction of SLE. However, choosing the right  features  is  crucial  in  training  a  model.  This  study  aims  to  enhance  the  predictive  capabilities  of  SLE  using  a  hybrid  approach  of Genetic Algorithm (GA) integrated with neural networks. The subset of features used by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is optimized by  feature  selection  using  GA.  The  proposed  model  is  GA-ANN,  and  experimental  results  indicate  that  the  model  performed  well  in comparison to other models, achieving an accuracy of 96.32%
